# Regression-Tree-for-LiDAR-data
Using data from a lidar system analysis, I have provided regression tree statistics, plots, and their accompanying CSV's in Python. 

# LiDAR 
This is a good article to understand lidar and it's purposes: https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/lidar-systems-simulation-and-validation/

# The data
Imagine the data being a distance of 0.1m to 3.1m, the X-axis, with values ranging from 0-5 (or whatever) on the Y-axis. This program plots models a regression tree on them and plots them. 

# Regression Tree
A type of machine learning, a good resource is here: https://towardsdatascience.com/regression-tree-in-python-from-scratch-9b7b64c815e3
